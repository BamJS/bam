**BAM!** makes it quick (hence, the name) and easy to get small applications up & running using Node.js and AWS.  It is optimized for deployment of AWS Lambda functions integrated with API Gateway endpoints but also allows for the creation of DynamoDB tables (which can help persist data between lambda invocations). 

As long as you meet the prerequisites (see below), there is no need to perform any configuration; BAM! presumes some configuration details by default and uses [AWS STS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) to pull in your account number.  That said, there is an option to update your default configuration if you'd like to do that.

Assuming you've written a JavaScript file according to the [AWS Lambda programming pattern for Node.js](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/programming-model.html), only one command is needed to push it to AWS and integrate it with an API Gateway endpoint.

If you're new to AWS Lambda, we've included templates for common scenarios (see documentation for `bam create` in the command section below). These will help you handle requests made using a variety of HTTP methods and expose query/path parameters.

For those more familiar with AWS, we did our best to make BAM! backwards-compatible to allow you to work with existing lambdas & make changes to resources using the AWS console (or other frameworks).

Thanks for trying out BAM!  We hope you'll like it! ðŸ’¥

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* AWS account
* AWS CLI
* Node.js >= 8.10
* NPM

BAM! requires that you have an account with AWS and you have set up an AWS CLI configuration on your local machine.  If you have not already done so, please visit [Configuring the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) for instructions.  BAM! will use the default profile and region you have specified within that profile when interacting with AWS services.


### Install BAM!
``` bash
npm install -g bam-lambda
```
